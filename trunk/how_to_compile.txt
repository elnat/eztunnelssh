Tested with Qt 4.3.2 at the time of writing.


On Windows with Visual Studio 2003 or 2005:
- Install Qt 4.3.2, compile it and set the environment variables correctly
  as per the Qt documentation (QTDIR, MKSPECS, PATH).
- Go to the "build" directory in this source and open a command line there.
- Run vcvars32.bat to setup the Visual Studio variables.
- Run "qmake -tp vc" to create the project file.
- Open the project file and save the solution (it will ask the first time
  you compile).
- Compile.
- You will need plink.exe in the ezTunnelSSH.exe directory to make it run.

On Linux:
- Install Qt 4.3.2, apt-get it or compile it and set the environment
  variables as per the Qt documentation (QTDIR, MKSPECS, PATH).
  "sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev" for debian-based systems.
- Go to the "build" directory in this source.
- Run "qmake".
- Run "make".


To clean the source:
- In the build directory, delete everything except ezTunnelSSH.pro.
